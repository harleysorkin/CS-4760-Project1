This is your warm up project building on your knowledge from CMPSCI 2750. The goal of this project is to become familiar
with the environment in hoare while practicing system calls. You will also demonstrate your proficiency in the use of
perror and getopt in this submission. Additionally, you should understand the different steps of compilation and linking,
and creating your executable. The project is a slight modification of Exercise 2.13 Message Logging (p. 55-56) in your text
by Robbins/Robbins. The modification is that each message will also issue a classification as to whether the message is
informational (INFO), warning (WARN), error (ERROR), or fatal (FATAL).
The logging utility to be developed by you allows the caller to save a message at the end of a list. The logger also records the
time that the message was logged. The sample log.h file (Program 2-11; p. 55) shows the data structures and prototypes of
the functions that will be needed.


This program is invoked with the command:

./driver [-h] [-t sec] [filename]

-h displays the help text
-t allows the user to set an average wait time between adding messages
And filename is the name of the file to be written to.
